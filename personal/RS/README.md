#Formatting data

unify_data.py changes data format from Protezione Civile to the format of Oxford data.
Now, creates two output files:
- regions.csv, with region's total daily cases
- districts.csv: with district's total daily cases

TO DECIDE:
- Basically we can use only districts.csv and to obtain region's data we can sum districts cases. 
- Append this to challenge file or not?
- Adding the same interventions of Italy (from challenge data) or not?
